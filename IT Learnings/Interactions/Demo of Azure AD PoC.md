```ad-important
title: Feedback from Tamil regarding the PoC
- Remove 'Click to Authenticate' button from react page and automatically redirect the user to Azure AD's login page
- Study about infrastructure needed for the services
	1. Is this the correct database server for this use-case?
	2. What is the infra needed for the apps to run (RAM/CPU/Storage)
- In this manner, study if is it possible to authenticate users with other IdPs like PingID, Okta etc., 
```
