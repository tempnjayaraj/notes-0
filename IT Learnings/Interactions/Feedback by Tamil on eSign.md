title: Points on eSign
1. Need to document requirement to be met from client's side 
	- Azure Portal configurations -> App Registration
2. Need to study about infrastructure needed for our service to run
	- Say for example-> For 100 users, the app needs 1GiB storage for 1 year and likewise
3.  Should make the service URLs configurable in our eSign app(In UI if possible) without modifying code
4.  Need to study about integrating our service with eSign App even if the company is using a Jira Data Center with firewall instead of Jira Cloud
