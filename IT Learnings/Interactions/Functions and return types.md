DRY Principle
Do not Repeat Yourself
Re-usable code

Function / Method

Input -> "Nivas D"
write a method to display the number of letter in the given name
method name -> countLetters("Nivas") ==> 5
method name -> capitalize("Nivas") ==> NIVAS
method name -> toggleCase("nivas dev ops") ==> Nivas Dev Ops
method name -> countWords("Hi how are you?") ==> 4
