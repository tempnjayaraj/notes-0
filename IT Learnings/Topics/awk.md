## About
`awk` is a powerful text-processing tool that is commonly used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. It is a scripting language that is designed for processing and manipulating text-based data, such as log files, database output, and other structured or unstructured text.

In Bash, `awk` can be used to perform a wide range of text-processing tasks, including searching for specific patterns or words in a text file, replacing text, and performing calculations on numerical data. `awk` works by scanning through a text file one line at a time, and performing actions based on the contents of the line.
