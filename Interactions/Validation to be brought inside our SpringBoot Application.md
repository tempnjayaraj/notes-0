Use cases to test tomorrow. 
1.  When Approval workflow is more than one and if any one of the user parallelly rejected the story , we should not allow the 2nd one to approve/reject
2.  If approval workflow has more than one user per role, then if first user takes action for the second user of same we should throw error
3.  We should throw error if user already approved in any of the other role
4.  Creator should not be the approver
5.  if the user is the last user in the workflow system should take the story to next workflow transition if user approves it 
for any doubts u can call me or Iyyappan regarding the same
