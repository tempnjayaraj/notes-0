This script does the job
![[Automate re-wording of all commits of all branches in the Git repository#^82946f]]


## EOD Status
Hi Sir,

I have got this script online which re-applies the commit messages to all commits in a branch. I have tested for a single branch and found it helpful. We could use this programmatically in our use case to make Jira Smart-Commits work in the Commit messages

Tomorrow I'd automate this script to help in our task.

After this is complete, I'll start working on VSS migration task Sir
